## FAQ — Is this really automation?

Yes. AutomationZ automates the process, not the timing.

AutomationZ is designed to remove repetitive, error-prone manual work, not to make decisions for you.

Before AutomationZ, changing server settings usually meant logging into FTP, navigating directories manually, remembering exact filenames and paths, risking typos (BBP vs BPP, case sensitivity), manually creating backups (or forgetting), and repeating the same steps across multiple servers.

AutomationZ automates all of that into one predefined, repeatable operation.

When you click **Upload**, AutomationZ automatically selects the correct local files from the chosen preset, maps them to the correct remote paths, ensures exact filename matching, optionally backs up existing server files, and uploads consistently across one or many servers.

The server owner still decides when to execute it. This keeps control in human hands, actions predictable, and servers safe from unintended changes.

AutomationZ focuses on controlled, safe automation, not unattended execution.

## FAQ — What AutomationZ does NOT do

AutomationZ is intentionally focused. To avoid confusion, here is what it does NOT do.

### It does NOT run by itself
AutomationZ does not run on timers, execute scheduled jobs by default, or apply changes without confirmation. Every action requires an explicit Upload click. This is intentional.

### It does NOT modify gameplay or server logic
AutomationZ does not inject code, modify binaries, hook into game engines, or alter gameplay behavior. It only uploads files you already control.

### It is NOT a game mod
AutomationZ is not loaded by the game, is not added to server startup parameters, does not require players to download anything, and does not affect client performance. It operates entirely outside the game.

### It does NOT replace server administration
AutomationZ does not decide when raids start, which rules are active, or how a server is moderated. Those decisions remain with the server owner. AutomationZ ensures execution is correct, not that decisions are made.

### It does NOT hide mistakes silently
AutomationZ is transparent by design. Missing files are shown clearly, mappings must match exactly, overwrites only occur on exact filename matches, and backups are explicit and visible.

## In short
AutomationZ automates how changes are applied, not when or why they are applied. That balance is what makes it reliable.
