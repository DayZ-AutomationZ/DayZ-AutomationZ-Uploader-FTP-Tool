❓ FAQ — “Is this really automation if I still click upload?”

Yes. AutomationZ automates the process, not the timing.

AutomationZ is designed to remove repetitive, error-prone manual work, not to make decisions for you.

Before AutomationZ, updating a server typically meant:

logging into FTP

navigating folders manually

remembering exact filenames

risking typos (BBP vs BPP, case sensitivity)

manually creating backups (or forgetting)

repeating the same steps for multiple servers

AutomationZ automates all of that into one predefined, repeatable operation.

When you click Upload, AutomationZ automatically:

selects the correct local files from a preset

maps them to the correct remote paths

ensures exact filename matching

optionally backs up existing server files

uploads consistently across one or many servers

The server owner still decides when to run it — intentionally.

This design keeps:

full control in human hands

actions predictable and reversible

servers safe from unintended changes

AutomationZ focuses on controlled, safe automation, not unattended or time-based automation.

Why not fully automatic or scheduled by default?

Fully automatic systems (timers, cron jobs) can:

apply changes at the wrong moment

be harder to debug

cause damage without confirmation

AutomationZ is built for server owners, not unattended scripts.

If you want full scheduling later, the architecture allows it — but it is deliberately not required to benefit from AutomationZ today.
